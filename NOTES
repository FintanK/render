Notes

Bower repos can be found with

    bower search <term>

Installing packages defined in bower.json

    bower install

All libraries / assets should then be copied into the src directory to be used and optimized later.

Not bothering with it as it installs entire repos.

Not using angular for this project. This one is a focus on usability.
